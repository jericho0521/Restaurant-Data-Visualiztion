## About The Project

**Objectives**

**1.	Gain insights from sales data**

Sales data enables data-driven decision-making. We can use these insights to make informed choices about marketing strategies, inventory management, pricing, and other critical aspects of the business. We are also able to learn about customer behavior, preferences, and buying patterns that can be used to tailor marketing efforts and improve customer satisfaction. This will further help in sales forecasting and planning to make more accurate predictions and develop effective sales strategies. 

**2.	Learn how customers engage with the business**

Learning about customer engagement is crucial for building loyal and long-lasting relationships with customers in the long term. By understanding a customerâ€™s emotional connection and interaction to the business, we can provide exceptional services that leave them satisfied with the experience and develop loyalty from them. In this way, loyal customers not only make repeat purchases but also act as brand advocates, recommending the business to others.

**3.	Compare branch performance**

Learning about comparing branch performance is a vital objective for businesses with multiple branches or locations such as The Parlay. This objective involves analyzing and understanding the performance of different branches to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. By comparing branch performance, businesses can make data-driven decisions, optimize operations, and drive overall growth. 

**4.	Convert data into visualization**

Visualizations present complex sales data in a visual format that is easy to interpret and understand. Charts, graphs, and infographics provide a clear representation of trends, patterns, and relationships in the data, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. By presenting our research in visualization format, we can highlight areas of underperformance or areas where the business might need improvement. This information can help guide efforts to optimize operations and increase sales.
